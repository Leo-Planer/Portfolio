1) Project summary / purpose

Build a modern, production-ready personal portfolio website that showcases projects, technical skills, and contact methods. The site must be developer-focused (clear technical signals), visually polished, accessible, and lightweight. It should be simple for the owner to update project entries and deploy to a typical hosting pipeline (Vercel / Netlify / Cloud provider).

2) Target audience & success metrics

Primary audience: hiring managers, technical interviewers, engineering peers, and potential clients.

Key impressions to deliver: competence with modern stacks, attention to detail, performance awareness, accessible UI.

Success criteria (measurable in acceptance tests): semantic structure, Lighthouse performance ≥ target (see Acceptance Criteria), WCAG AA accessibility, fast first meaningful paint on mobile, project pages with live/demo and repo links.

3) Tech stack & architecture (required)

Primary stack (preferred):

Next.js 15 with TypeScript (app router or pages can be used but indicate which in the repo).

Material UI (MUI) for components and theming (v5+), combined with Tailwind CSS for layout and utility classes. Use MUI for core components and Tailwind for layout spacing & small utilities.

Framer Motion for animations.

ESLint + Prettier with a standard config.

Vitest / Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests (small set of tests required).

Data source: projects stored as MDX or a versioned JSON file in the repo; optionally support Sanity / Contentful or GitHub Actions to sync.

Deployment: Vercel recommended. CI via GitHub Actions (lint/test/build).

If implementer prefers an alternate stack (Remix, Astro, or SSG-only), keep the same accessibility and performance targets.

4) Visual and interaction design guidelines

Visual tone: modern minimalism, slightly technical. Clean typography, clear spacing, restrained color accents for primary brand color.

Layout: mobile-first responsive layout. Desktop: multi-column grid for projects; mobile: stacked single-column.

Colors: produce a light and dark theme. Provide CSS variables or MUI theme tokens for primary/secondary/background/surface/error. Keep contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA.

Typography: system stack + variable font (Inter or Roboto). Scale headings with modular scale (H1 → H2 → H3).

Motion: subtle, purposeful — components should animate on enter/hover (Framer Motion). Avoid large motion that causes motion sickness; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Micro-interactions: hover states for project cards, focus states for interactive elements, transition for theme toggle.

5) Pages, components and content requirements
Core pages

Home / Landing — Hero (name, role, short tagline, CTA to projects and contact), one-line summary of skills, highlighted project carousel/tiles, latest blog or technical note (optional).

Projects — grid/list of projects with filters (by tech tag) and search. Each project card: screenshot, title, short blurb (2–3 lines), tech tags, links to demo & source, stack summary, and “View details” CTA.

Project detail page — full description, problem solved, technical approach, key screenshots, architecture diagram (optional), lessons learned, links.

About — short bio, skill matrix (icons + proficiency), resume download link, contact points.

Contact — contact form (serverless submit or integration like Resend/EmailJS) and social links.

404 — polished custom 404 with a CTA back to home.

Privacy / Terms — minimal page if form or analytics used.

Reusable components

Navbar with theme toggle and compact mobile menu (hamburger with accessible ARIA).

Footer with social links and copy.

ProjectCard (MUI Card + Tailwind layout) with keyboard focus states.

Tag / Chip component (MUI Chip styled).

Modal or Drawer for mobile project preview.

Icon set: use MUI icons and custom SVGs for logos or hero illustration.

Image component: Next/Image or equivalent responsive image loader with AVIF/WebP support.

6) UX details & interactions

Keyboard navigable site. All interactive elements reachable by Tab. Visible focus outline.

Theme toggle persists in localStorage and respects OS preference on first load.

Project filter should be accessible and usable with keyboard and screen readers.

Contact form: validate client-side & server-side; show success and error states. Implement rate-limiting or honeypot for spam mitigation.

Prefetch project pages on hover for fast transitions (Next.js prefetch).

7) Accessibility and SEO

Semantic HTML and landmarks: header, main, nav, footer, article.

Alt text for every image; descriptive labels for form elements.

ARIA attributes where needed (aria-expanded, aria-controls, role for non-semantic interactive items).

Color contrast meets WCAG AA for normal text and UI controls.

Structured data (JSON-LD) for person and projects: include name, role, social links, and project metadata on project pages.

Meta tags for each page (title, description, open graph tags, Twitter card).

Sitemap.xml and robots.txt in repo.

Server-side rendering for pages where SEO matters (home, projects, project detail).

8) Performance & optimization

Code-splitting and route-based chunking.

Use responsive images with srcset or Next/Image. Serve modern formats (AVIF/WebP).

Avoid large JS bundles; limit third-party scripts.

Defer non-critical CSS and inline critical above-the-fold styling if needed.

Lighthouse targets: Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO — include target thresholds as acceptance criteria below.

9) Developer experience, code quality & repo structure (suggested)

Monorepo not necessary. Keep single repo with clear scripts.

Branching: main protected, PRs for features with CI checks.

README: setup, run, build, deploy instructions, content edit instructions.

Linters and formatters run in pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged).

Suggested folder layout:

/src
  /app or /pages
  /components
    /ui
    /layout
    /projects
  /lib
    analytics.ts
    mail.ts
  /styles
  /data
    projects.json or projects/*.mdx
/public
  /images
  favicon.ico
tailwind.config.ts
next.config.js
tsconfig.json
package.json
README.md

10) Tests and QA

Unit tests: key presentational components (ProjectCard, Tag, theme toggle).

End-to-end smoke (optional): visit home, open project, submit contact form (can be mocked).

Accessibility audit: axe-core or Lighthouse programmatic check in CI.

Visual regression: optional (Chromatic or Playwright snapshots).

11) CI/CD & deployment

GitHub Actions workflow:

On PR: run npm ci, npm run lint, npm run test.

On merge to main: build and deploy to Vercel (or run npm run build and upload).

Environment variables documented in README (for email provider, analytics keys).

12) Analytics & observability

Optional: lightweight analytics (Plausible, Umami, or Vercel Analytics). Avoid heavy trackers.

Error reporting: Sentry or Vercel logs only if needed.

Privacy-friendly default (do not enable analytics by default; require opt-in).

13) Content and assets (what you must provide)

High-quality profile photo (square & medium resolution).

Project images/screenshots or animated GIFs (desktop + mobile).

Short portfolio headline (1 line) and a 2–3 paragraph bio.

For each project: title, URL (demo), repo link, 2–3 sentence summary, tech tags, at least one screenshot.

Resume PDF for a download link.

Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter / X, Dribbble if design).

14) Deliverables (what to expect)

Complete repo with working site and build scripts.

README with setup and deploy instructions.

Small test-suite and CI workflow file.

A minimal admin content workflow (how to add/edit projects).

Deployed public URL on Vercel (or deployment instructions if deploy access not available).

Design tokens / MUI theme file and Tailwind config.

15) Acceptance criteria (hard checks)

All pages render server-side or statically with correct meta tags.

Site passes accessibility checks: no axe critical violations and WCAG AA contrast on text.

Lighthouse: Accessibility and Best Practices ≥ 90; SEO ≥ 90; Performance target is high but acceptable lower bound should be stated in the PR description for reviewers to judge (aim for 80+ on desktop; mobile may vary).

All interactive elements keyboard operable and focus visible.

Contact form submits and returns success with a mocked endpoint in staging.

Projects data editable as a file (MDX/JSON) and reflected on build without code changes.

README includes exactly these commands: npm install, npm run dev, npm run build, npm run start, npm run lint, npm run test.
